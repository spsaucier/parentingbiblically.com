(and God and His children)</p><blockquote><p>Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him. <cite>Pr 13:24 - ESV</cite></p></blockquote><p>How much of our child-raising is based on cultural rather than biblical truths? Biblical discipline refers to heart training, not just spanking or time outs. It seeks to drive the “folly” out of a child.</p><blockquote><p>A youngster’s heart is filled with foolishness, but discipline will drive it away. <cite>Pr 22:15 - NLT</cite></p></blockquote><p>Discipline comes from the same root as disciple, and it is a process of training &amp; teaching that fosters moral development. The positive aspects of discipline are emphasis of inner growth, personal responsibility, and self-control.</p><blockquote><p>Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life. <cite>Pr 4:23 - NKJV</cite></p></blockquote><p>Parents who biblically discipline tend to need to use punishment far less than those who don’t because they are shaping a child’s heart, not just changing behavior. The Bible does not frequently give specific disciplinary techniques to be used in child-raising. Instead, it gives principles on which to base these techniques. We must always weigh our techniques against scripture to see if they, indeed, hold up to biblical standards and principles.</p><h3 id="instruction">Instruction</h3><p>Before we can expect our children to know what is expected of them, what is right and wrong, they must receive instruction. Most of what they learn is from watching you, but you must also verbally teach.</p><blockquote><p>The purpose of these proverbs is to teach people wisdom and discipline, and to help them understand wise sayings. Through these proverbs, people will receive instruction in discipline, good conduct, and doing what is right, just, and fair. These proverbs will make the simpleminded clever. They will give knowledge and purpose to young people. <cite>Pr 1:2-4</cite></p><p>Let those who are wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser. And let those who understand receive guidance by exploring the depth of meaning in these proverbs, parables, wise sayings, and riddles. Fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge. Only fools despise wisdom and discipline. <cite>Pr 1:5-7 - NLT</cite></p><p>Discipline your son, and he will give you peace; he will bring delight to your soul. <cite>Pr 29:17 - NIV</cite></p><p>Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. <cite>Pr 22:6 - NKJV</cite></p></blockquote><p>Instruction, training, and correction (here, meaning to educate) are necessary to teach your child what is right and wrong, to help him see the path which he should take.</p><blockquote><p>Discipline your children while there is hope. If you don’t, you will ruin their lives. <cite>Pr 19:18 - NLT</cite></p></blockquote><p>This is translated as “destruction” in many translations, but it does not refer to physical destruction but spiritual. Of course, if we as parents are not living what we preach, our instruction is usually worthless since the child sees we do not practice what we preach.</p><p>Many, probably most, decisions and activities of life have no morality attached to them—they are simply things we do. These behaviors are to be treated differently than those requiring moral decisions. At the same time, we are to encourage our children in amoral areas, too.</p><p>All of us have skills (things we have learned to do), talents (natural God-given abilities), and gifts (a magnified or potentially spiritual talent). We are to assist our children in acquiring and improving these aspects of their lives also. Skill acquisition requires patience, guidance, and motivation. Methods of motivation can be divided into verbal praise and goal incentives. Verbal praise lets your child know that you love them and are pleased by their behavior. It encourages the child regarding their progress in the disciplinary process. Goal incentives are tangible rewards given to encourage effort and progress in skills development. Be sure that incentives are appropriate for age and the task at hand. Do not use a goal set too high or the child may be discouraged.</p><blockquote><p>A word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver. <cite>Pr 25:11 - NIV</cite></p></blockquote><p>Discipline has 2 aspects: <strong>Encouragement</strong> and <strong>Correction</strong>. Encouragement teaches, trains, and rewards right behaviors. Correction is warranted when wrong behaviors have occurred in order to cause repentance.</p><h2 id="encouragement">Encouragement</h2><p><em>Pre-activity encouragement</em> comes verbally before a required behavior is expected. This reminds and prepares the child in advance so that they remember what behaviors are expected of them.</p><p>Verbal reminders: “Remember, when you meet so-and-so today, shake their hand and say, ‘Hello, Ms. <em>__</em>’”</p><p><strong>Dialogue questions</strong>: role play the situation which is about to happen, e.g., “Who can tell me the rules for when we go in the store?” (This is especially good for young children to take ownership of actions) Positive words: Attempt to speak as often as possible in positive words. Instead of saying, “Don’t spill your cereal on your way to the table,” consider saying, “See how carefully you can carry your cereal to the table.” Instead of saying, “Don’t get out of bed,” consider, “Obey mommy and stay in bed.”</p><p><em>Post-activity encouragement</em> comes after the fact.</p><p><strong>Affirmation</strong>: Verbally encourage your kids in the little things and the big. Consider saying, “I need (your help)” instead of “I want” or “do this.” Say “great job,” or “great game” with your hand on their shoulder. Hugs are always welcome. (Helpful hint for kids AND spouses!) Be careful not to qualify your encouragement: “Thanks for doing the dishes tonight, even though you did a poor job.”</p><p>Affirming words from moms and dads are like light switches. Speak a word of affirmation at the right moment in a child’s life, and it’s like lighting up a whole roomful of possibilities. Gary Smalley</p><p><strong>Rewards</strong>: tangible or intangible (gum vs. trip to park). These are used to reinforce behavior after the fact, not to stimulate it. “Because you were so good in the store today, Mom wants to buy you a special treat.” Offering something in exchange for good behavior prior to the action is bribing. That manipulates a child’s lust of the flesh and eyes. (I Jn. 2:16a) Don’t overuse rewards, or a child becomes conditioned and dependent on receiving them; make them occasional and special.</p><h2 id="correction">Correction</h2><p>There are 2 goals in the correction process: helping the child take ownership of their actions/decisions, and helping them learn to make wise ones. Allowing them to suffer the consequences of their actions will most quickly teach them to change behaviors to bring about something more pleasant. If they are not allowed to suffer from bad decisions, they will continue to act in the same fashion, and these actions will become habitual and difficult to remove. (I see this in the emergency room every day.) Some rebellious or defiant behaviors will bring about natural consequences which will deter further similar actions, e.g., touching a hot stove after being warned. Others may not have consequences, so a parent must step in and be sure that actions have consequences that will cause the child to regret their bad decision. A healthy parent-child relationship is a necessary first priority, and correction is only one part of the discipline process. As we have learned, proper view of authority is vital; submission to scripture, essential. Outside of rightful administration, correction may actually be aggression or revenge.</p><p><strong>Punishment</strong> is the fitting retribution of an offense; it is the application of unpleasant actions given as a consequence of a person’s bad actions. It communicates the value of evil to each wrongful act. It should be only part of correction and assists in changing behavior by making wrong behavior unpleasant. Punishment alone often has undesirable effects. (You will see many definitions of punishment in relation to child-raising depending on the source used, especially sources from different cultures or countries. Be careful of semantics in this area.)</p><p><strong>Correction</strong> is the act of bringing back from error or unacceptable deviation from the standard. The type of correction depends on the presence or absence of evil motive. Ask yourself, “Was my child’s wrong action accidental or intentional?” The answer determines which type of correction is appropriate. Bad decisions and accidents bring consequences (natural or logical); intentional moral violations affecting other people require punishment—the active application of unpleasant consequences. Punishment/consequences should fit the crime. We make a value judgment by the amount of punishment assigned. Ask yourself, “What punishment would fit the wrong and convey the right value message?”</p><p><strong>Childishness</strong>: Acting inappropriately with no ill-will or rebellion inherent in the act; being a kid. Punishment is not appropriate for these behaviors, but possibly education about better choices would be in order.</p><p><strong>Admonishment</strong>: Warning a child that an action or lack of action is unwise and may bring a bad result. (e.g. , leaving tools outside.) You shouldn’t necessarily punish a child for a mild infraction if he is normally characterized by immediate compliance and admonishment will suffice. Don’t get carried away, as children become exasperated when parents demand perfection and not just excellence. Related consequences: they need to be logical and related to the mistake. Their purpose is to encourage good stewardship and to cause child to accept responsibility for actions. Explanations should always accompany training. Explanations should get briefer as children grow up. Denying privileges for not obeying completely is acceptable. Consequential punishment involves different types of applied consequences which bring some sort of pain into the life of the child, through either natural or logical consequences, loss of privileges, restitution, and chastisement.</p><p><strong>Foolishness</strong>: Willful, intentional defiance and open rebellion are what the Bible calls foolishness. (Pr 22:15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him. NIV)</p><p><strong>Folly</strong>: deception, trickery, disobedience, lacking in wisdom, or rebellion. A fool is an adult whose parents have never trained the foolishness out of him. Our job is to help transform the heart from what it is naturally to what it should be biblically. Disobeying, talking back, refusing to accept correction, and rejecting any form of authority are all expressions of direct, willful defiance. A haughty look, pretending not to hear, pleading ignorance to the obvious after being caught in a misdeed, doing something “good” or “cute” to get out of doing what was instructed, and constantly saying, “I forgot”, are various forms of a more passive, indirect defiance. So is sulking, pouting, and whining.</p><p>Consider <strong>four factors</strong> when deciding how to correct a child’s foolish actions:</p><ol><li><em>Frequency of the offense</em></li><li><em>Age of the child</em></li><li><em>Context of the moment</em></li><li><em>Overall characterization of behavior</em></li></ol><p>Don’t apply rules randomly or have rules for which there is no room for change. Try to make discipline rational and specific. Be flexible when appropriate in order to have discipline make sense. If it is clearly too harsh or too mild, it may cause resentment or mocking—both poor results.</p><h2 id="fearing-your-child-s-response">Fearing your child’s response</h2><p>It is understandable to fear that your child may have an “adverse reaction” to discipline. Take a look at this plea from Job:</p><blockquote><p>With a strong hand, God grabs my shirt. He grips me by the collar of my coat. 19 He has thrown me into the mud. I’m nothing more than dust and ashes. I cry to you, O God, but you don’t answer. I stand before you, but you don’t even look. 21 You have become cruel toward me. You use your power to persecute me.  You throw me into the whirlwind and destroy me in the storm. 23 And I know you are sending me to my death — the destination of all who live. <cite>Job 30:18-23 NLT</cite></p></blockquote><p>Here Job is severely distraught (understandably) and believes that God Himself has not only abandoned him, but is even persecuting him. Now, of course, God did nothing wrong—He was doing something for His glory and, ultimately, Job’s good. It was not until later that Job fully understood this. This will be true for your children as well.</p><p>I can remember at about the age of 8-10, my parents simply made me stop watching a TV program I wanted to watch and go to bed—on a school night. It was fully appropriate for them to do so. I was livid! I remember climbing the stairs to my room, stating out loud, “I hate you! I hate you!” Clearly, that was childish and foolish behavior. Your children will do the same! If they act this way, lovingly take them aside, get in their face, and remind them why you do the things that you do—because you love them, and right by God is right indeed! By far the best way to avoid seeing this type of response is to be as consistent as possible. This is the best way to avoid frustration. But even then, sometimes a child will give a wrong response. It does not mean that you were wrong in the disciplinary action (but always examine what just occurred).</p><h2 id="three-hard-fast-rules-">Three Hard &amp; Fast rules:</h2><p><em>These should never be broken.</em></p><ol><li><strong>Do not leave your correction to your spouse</strong>. Several things can potentially happen. First, children will learn that the “non-correcting” parent is not to be truly respected—they do nothing without the “correcting” parent, and many times they will just let things slide either because it is easier or they forget. They will begin to behave worse and worse with less respect towards this “lame” parent. Second, they may begin to hate when—typically the Father—comes home because he comes home to punish children for things he has not witnessed or been part of. This may cause distance in that relationship, and it will surely cause friction in the marriage. It is sort of a “good-cop, bad-cop” parenting situation. If need for punishment arises, deal with it then and there whenever possible. Don’t wait and make someone else deal with it.</li><li><strong>Never reveal parental conflict</strong> over discipline issues in front of the child. As we have said before, whenever possible, take the discussion over punishment/discipline issues somewhere else to clarify and agree so a united front is presented to the child. This keeps the child from pitting one parent against another and also keeps them from possibly always blaming one parent for being too strict and the other too weak. They will pick up on parental conflict very quickly and use this.</li><li>You must <strong>be consistent in responding</strong> to bad—or good—behaviors. Being inconsistent may truly frustrate your child (they do not know what to expect and are often surprised) or they may enjoy this and treat it as a type of gambling. Some children will repeatedly be bad in order to test you, wear you out, and “win” the struggle. They are gambling that you will not respond with discipline but instead become angry, tired, and not punish them. This is very dangerous.</li></ol><hr><div class="lesson-nav"><a class="prev" href="/lessons/obedience/">&larr; Obedience</a> <a class="next right" href="/lessons/consequences-chastisement/">Consequences & Chastisement &rarr;</a></div></div><script src="/assets/vendor.js" async></script><script src="/assets/app.js" async></script><script>var refTagger = {
