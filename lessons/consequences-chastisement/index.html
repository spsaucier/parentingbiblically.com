The lack of physical pain causes some pretty severe pathology. For example, when pain is not present from diabetic neuropathy, infection is able to run rampant without early detection, leading to amputations—or worse. Without pain from our bad behaviors, we may be led to believe that nothing is wrong with the action that we just performed. What do you do when you encounter pain? Pain warns us that something is not right, and it teaches us to stop doing whatever we are doing! Pain helps a child gain focus and self-control over destructive behavior.</p><blockquote><p>Life is full of pain—it is unavoidable. It is not so important to always avoid pain but, instead, teach your child how to handle pain and control his reaction. <cite>—Frank Saucier</cite></p><p>Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. <cite>—M. Kathleen Casey</cite></p><p>We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment. <cite>—Jim Rohn</cite></p></blockquote><p>Pain in regard to discipline has two forms: <em>natural consequence</em> (natural outcome of wrong behavior) and <em>structured consequence</em> (brought into the child’s life through active punishment).</p><p><strong>Natural consequences</strong>: Sometimes consequences of foolish behavior are painful in nature, e.g., slipping and falling when told not to run around the pool. This usually teaches the offender why he should have obeyed in the first place, and further punishment is not normally necessary. This is normally not the method of choice as it can be dangerous. Whenever possible, it is wiser to head it off in the first place before injury occurs.</p><p><strong>Structured consequences</strong>: When foolish behavior does not cause pain in itself, it then needs to be created artificially through structured consequences. This needs to be clear and consistent; children have contempt for weak authority and soon mock that authority. The child needs to know that punishment is exact and certain in order to learn to control his behavior.</p><p>There are three main types of structured consequences:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Logical consequences</strong>: Parents must always choose a method of punishment which “fits the crime”; it should be logical. If the purpose is to teach self-control according to moral principle, it will be better understood and remembered if it makes logical sense. This more often is for older children and involves taking away of privileges, “toys”, cell phones/computer time, or events; or it may be extra work duties or restoration of some type. This is very broad in nature and will vary with each circumstance. It takes into account the situation as well as age and motivation of the child. It is not used often in small children as they will not learn from principles involved—they better understand physical pain.</p></li><li><p><strong>Isolation</strong>: This is the temporary removal of social contact, sometimes called “time out”. We are social beings, and children love to be with others most of the time. This timeout is used as punishment for poor behavior. Reflective timeout, studied earlier, is removal of contact before a bad outcome occurs. Time out may be used with other punishments, but care must be taken to not rely on it solely or too often. We used it mostly for lesser offenses, more childish as opposed to rebellious behaviors. It is to teach the child self-control. It also must be painful; it the child does not care or has fun when in time out, it is not effective and mocks discipline itself. Isolation is frequently not adequate to remove guilt which we cover below.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chastisement</strong> (physical): This is the biblical term for applying physical pain as a means of amending behavior; in our society this is typically spanking. Spanking is using controlled force to cause physical pain and amend an inner attitude. While it should always be associated with rebellion, rebellion is not always punished with spanking. When a child knows that he broke the rules, he will feel guilt; guilt is the reminder of sin. This guilt can often be dealt with and relieved best by chastisement/spanking—truly! Chastisement is the price paid for the rebellion to remove the guilt, and this frees the child from continuous guilt. Children who carry guilt endlessly may become callused to rebellion and more easily fall into repetitive disobedience and sin. If a child is freed from his guilt caused by his disobedience, he can then be restored into a right relationship with his parents, and life can then move forward again. (This is what God does with us.) I can vividly remember all of our children being hurt by their guilt and punishment, and then made whole again when the disciplinary process is done properly. As we are restored to a right relationship with God by our repentance, so our children can be restored unto us by properly administered chastisement. There is plenty of biblical support for this.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Chasten</strong>: to inflict suffering upon for purposes of moral improvement; chastise.</p><blockquote><p>You should know in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you. <cite>Dt 8:5 - NKJV</cite></p><p>I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of men. <cite>2 Sa 7:14 - NKJV</cite></p><p>He who withholds his rod hates his son, But he who loves him disciplines him diligently. <cite>Pr 13:24 - NASU</cite></p><p>Chasten your son while there is hope, And do not set your heart on his destruction*. <cite>Pr 19:18 - NKJV</cite></p><p>Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; The rod of correction will drive it far from him. <cite>Pr 22:15 - NKJV</cite></p><p>Do not withhold correction from a child, For if you beat him with a rod, he will not die. 14 You shall beat him with a rod, And deliver his soul from hell. <cite>Pr 23:13 - NKJV</cite></p><p>Don’t fail to correct your children. They won’t die if you spank them. Physical discipline may well save them from death. <cite>Pr 23:13-14 - NLT</cite></p><p>The rod and reproof give wisdom, But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother. <cite>Pr 29:15 - NASU</cite></p><p>To discipline and reprimand a child produces wisdom, but a mother is disgraced by an undisciplined child. <cite>Pr 29:15 - NLT</cite></p><p>What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness? <cite>1 Co 4:21 - NASU</cite></p></blockquote><p>Read Hebrews 12:4-11 in your Bible. Study it. See how it applies to you and how you can apply it to your children. Don’t skip this! Do it! Do it now!</p><blockquote><p>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent. <cite>Rv 3:19 - NKJV</cite></p></blockquote><p>What a loving God we have that He should consider us and treat us as His Children! Parents who love their children will chastise, yes, spank, their children. Do not fear losing your child’s love (or being politically correct!) more than obeying God’s will. God will use this to do a work in your children for their good; our obedience does matter greatly.</p><p>Do not be a parent like Eli who was warned in I Sam 2: 22-35, who lost all that he had because of his parenting priorities. Even King David made terrible parenting mistakes. Regarding his son Adonijah, I Kings 1:6 says, “ His father had never crossed (interfered, disciplined, rebuked) him at any time…” Adonijah tried to take the throne near David’s death. One of David’s other sons raped his half-sister, was murdered by his half-brother who eventually briefly took the throne from David himself.</p><p><strong>The Rod of Reproof</strong>: <em>Rod</em> is used in the Old Testament in several different contexts. It is a symbol of guidance and care; authority and rulership, to perform miracles; and a symbol of chastisement and anger. Regarding children, it refers to an instrument of correction (above). It also was used for chastisement of others.</p><blockquote><p>A whip for the horse, a halter for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools! <cite>Pr 26: 3 - NIV</cite></p><p>Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks judgment. <cite>Pr 10:13</cite></p></blockquote><h3 id="specifics-on-spanking">Specifics on spanking</h3><p><strong>How to administer chastisement</strong>: There are several components to biblical chastisement which are beneficial and help with “checks and balances” to avoid harm. (Truly, these apply to all type of discipline/chastisement.) When a child first has become rebellious:</p><ol><li>The child must then and there be made aware that he has broken the rules, and understand that punishment follows. If too much time passes, many children, especially small ones, may have no clue what they have done wrong. Keep it fresh in the mind.</li><li>They must be moved to where they can be punished without embarrassment or public ridicule for either the parent or the child.</li><li>They must be told what they did wrong, why they knew that this was wrong, and that they are going to be spanked for their actions/behavior. Be sure that they know that their behavior is what began the whole reaction of punishment. They are responsible. (Use the word “you” often if needed.)</li><li>Generally, we then told our child to go to their room and that we would be there shortly to administer chastisement. This accomplishes 2 purposes: it allows the child to think about their sinful/foolish behavior and how they might have avoided it, and it allows the parent to get in the right mind, get his wits about him, calm down, and face the spanking. Sometimes this is to get rid of anger, other times it is to avoid smiling; often it is to consider what to say in order to teach &amp; discipline your child through this. Don’t wait too long as you or the child may forget the event and nothing is learned.</li><li>Spank the child using the guidelines below:<ul><li>Let the child be alone again to quit crying, regain their composure, and consider repentance. This again allows time for the parent to consider teaching.</li><li>When the child is calm, go back to teach and restore the child. This involves reminding of the offense, why it was foolish, teaching ways to avoid future similar behaviors, and a reminder that we discipline and even spank because we love them! (This will be covered more in the future.) Take them back to the Holiness, Truth, Love of God (etc.) so that they see we operate on the perfect standard. We act this way because God acts this way. This is extremely important!</li><li>The child should then say words that they have been taught (by you): “I’m sorry that I [disobeyed you]. Will you forgive me?” They need to be taught this before this time and learn to say it without difficulty remembering. Of course, remind them, if needed. If they are not ready to say this, leave the room again and let them think about it some more. Sometimes it takes 2-3 more “isolation breaks” for them to realize that they need to repent. When they do, we recommend immediate restoration and a big hug. Remind them again that you love them. You generally need not bring this up again—it is over. Do NOT bring this up again—they are forgiven at this point as God forgives us—forever.</li></ul></li></ol><p>You can find some more useful information <a target="_blank" _ href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/parenting/effective-biblical-discipline/effective-child-discipline/biblical-approach-to-spanking">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Instrumentation</strong>: A biblical rod came from a tree branch or bush stem. Ezzo believes that things unbending should not be used as they may break fingers that get in the way or cause serious damage. Our reply is that if you might break fingers, you are not in control of your anger or your arm! Most any instrument may be used so long as it is used thoughtfully—meaning the force used should match the instrument. We normally used a very firm object but did not strike with reckless abandon. (We broke several wooden spoons but never fingers.) A belt, on the other hand, can more easily exceed the intended force used and cause real harm or injury. In short, take care with whatever you use.</p><p>We chose not to use our hands whenever possible because we always wanted our hands to show love, not pain; we never wanted our children to fear the touch of our hand. Once in a while we were forced to use the hand, but we do not recommend it as general practice.</p><p><strong>Force</strong>: This will vary with the age of the child, the instrument used, and the offense. Generally, younger children only need one good swat while older may need several. A harder, larger instrument requires less force for pain, and a more serious offense should be more memorable. Match rebellious attitude with greater “adjustment”. If it does not cause significant pain, it is not accomplishing the purpose for which it is intended, and it will not only not help, it may possibly be worse than doing nothing. It is like no discipline.</p><p><strong>Application</strong>: Spankings should normally be on the buttock covered by modest clothing. Sometimes the upper thigh is better or as good. Small children will usually respond well to smaller infractions by a slap on the hand. Again, this should hurt and cause crying. Never strike the child anywhere on the face or head; this causes ridicule and humiliation which is never the goal of biblical parenting. Godly, biblical chastisement will not break the spirit of the child (it hopefully will break his rebellious will), but a lack of love and humiliation will break the spirit and potentially cause deep harm. God does not ridicule us; we must not ridicule our children.</p><p>We think it’s wise to have the child bend over and grab their calves, not letting go until spanking is finished. If they put their hands back there, they will get hit and a normal spanking still follows.</p><p>Occasionally with small children out in public, something must be done at the time, and spanking is not an option. We often would place our hand on their inner thigh and tell them what was to happen—either a pinch for foolishness or a warning to regain their composure or a pinch would follow. Older children may need reminding of the rules and that they will receive their consequences for their behavior when they get home again. On rare occasion, completely ignoring tantrums or other behaviors may be the best public option—with other consequences to follow later. Only ignore bad behavior if you cannot deal with it immediately and intend to deal with it definitively later.</p><p>Children who are spanked more often early in life typically require much less spanking—and chastisement—overall. They learn early on to control their actions and behavior, so discipline later is much smoother. Spankings will become less over time and should be almost gone before age 10, most by age 5-6.</p><h3 id="why-chastisement-sometimes-fails-to-work-">Why chastisement sometimes fails to work.</h3><ul><li>Parents are inconsistent in application; it brings about a feeling of gambling or frustration. Better to not spank at all. This is your toughest problem as it takes time and effort.</li><li>It is not painful enough—perhaps using the wrong instrument, too thick clothing, not enough force or number of swats, parent not convinced that this is truly the best punishment.</li><li>Parents talk too much, making it too difficult for the child to remember and understand what he has done wrong or become bored with the whole process.</li><li>Failing to establish clear boundaries and guidelines.</li><li>Children feel like the only true attention they get is during the spanking process. (Ouch!)</li><li>Far too much has been done by poor parenting techniques over time to rely heavily on chastisement.</li></ul><h3 id="what-is-to-be-avoided-">What is to be avoided:</h3><ul><li>Physical harm; only physical pain should occur.</li><li>Stay far away from any abusive behaviors: verbal aggression, verbal assaults, excessive &amp; out-of-control physical punishment, uncontrolled emotions, and absence of reason—sin on your part! If you are out of control, get away and seek help if necessary. Never discipline when out of control; better to wait and deal with it later.</li></ul><h3 id="repentance-relationship">Repentance &amp; Relationship</h3><p>A person can regret their actions but still not be repentant. We see famous people everyday “regretting” their actions but not repenting—not admitting moral fault, turning away, and asking forgiveness. Children will typically express regret and sorrow for their offense when they get caught. We, and our children, need to be truly repentant and seek forgiveness when we sin against another person.</p><blockquote><p>Yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. 10 Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. <cite>2 Co 7:9 - NIV</cite></p></blockquote><p>Just as our relationship with God is harmed when we sin, our children’s relationship with us is hurt when they disobey. When the child realizes that his actions have affected the relationship and repents, asking forgiveness, true repentance occurs. This will repair the relationship.</p><p>When we look at Judges, we see a repetitive cycle where God’s people sin, are separated from God, repent, and are restored. Life is very much like this, and our children will know that they need restoration. In order for this to happen the child needs a contrite heart and asking forgiveness is necessary for the process to be complete. A child may say, “I’m sorry” for a mistake, but restoration from sin and rebellion requires repentance and forgiveness. A child not allowed forgiveness may carry long-term guilt.</p><p>Restitution is repayment for lost, damaged, or stolen property. Exodus 22 has several rules in this regard. There are times when your child should make restitution for things they may have broken in order to restore a relationship. Sometimes you will need to help with this. Base your dealings on the situation at hand.</p><p>If your child confesses wrongdoing before being caught, praise him for honesty, but he still (likely) needs to be punished for the wrong. Your punishment may be changed by his good actions. Sometimes they will only confess when they know they are going to get caught anyway. This does not mean much!</p><p>Make sure that your children see and experience you asking forgiveness, both from God for infractions against Him, and from them if you commit sin against them. This will make the whole restitution process much more meaningful and easier after chastisement.</p><blockquote><p>Too many parents are not on spanking terms with their children. <cite>Anonymous</cite></p></blockquote><h2 id="questions">Questions</h2><ol><li>What is the purpose of a reward?
